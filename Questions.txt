stock_prices
    1) Given the example find_max_profit([1050, 270, 1540, 3800, 2]) -> 3530
        - how is the max profit calculated?
        - The readme shows:
            "For this problem, we essentially want to find the difference between the smallest and largest
                prices in the list of prices.",
            but if this were true, wouldn't the answer be 3798?
